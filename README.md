# Minecraft-Mod-Manager
A Java application to manage Minecraft Mods in your `mods` folder. Only works with Minecraft Java Edition.

# Installing
- Ensure Java 17+ is installed
- Make a folder named `unloaded_mods` in `%appdata%\.minecraft\`
- Run the latest release

# How it works
This application essentially just moves the mods between two folders to load and unload them.
- The 'Add' button opens a file chooser to add mods
- The 'Remove' button moves the selected file in the list to the `unloaded_mods` folder

# Notes
- Only works on Windows, hasn't been tested for MacOS or Linux
- This is a quick project I did for myself, dont expect many if at all any updates
- Criticism on code is appreciated!
